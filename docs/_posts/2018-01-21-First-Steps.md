# First Steps in Kaggle

Maybe I’ve been away from python for too long. Maybe I’ve been working with too many websites. The first couple days of this learning adventure have been a bit of a struggle trying to work out intricacies of the python notebook.

Whilst I understand the first tutorial in Kaggle, I was a little stumped by the Jupiter notebook. This thing just did not appear to play happily with any text symptoms or IDE that I previously used. The Jupiter notebook seems to be the de facto standard for creating journals in Kaggle. Despite having worked with Python for several years, the Jupiter format has been a bit of a challenge. 

Rather than creating a whole new tutorial for this, I’m going to simply point to an excellent tutorial by [Corey Scaefer](https://youtu.be/HW29067qVWk) which explains the whole thing. Perhaps Kaggle should point to this as a starting point.
