# So I'm going to learn something new

Its going to be machine learning, Its going to be cool, and I'm going to use Kaggle.

## Why?

I keep getting cool competition emails from Kaggle.  I signed up about a year ago as I thought it would be a cool skill to have. but haven't gotten around to doing much about it yet.  I've kinda got rusty with python as I'm mostly using the .NET framework a lot. and sometimes looking at the same problems from another angle is the way forward.

## Why the blog

To be honest - its a good intention thing.  I intent to keep notes as I go, and Github enables me to do this well. I'm also practicing using Jekyll as a CMS a bit more.
